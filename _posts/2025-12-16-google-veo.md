Google Veo is fantastic.  The image is on par with Kling.  

However, it fails to grasp the spirit of the prompt.  My prompt was, "Effeminate Space Emperor jumps to his feet.  He starts stamping his feet while shouting in his girly voice, "I SHALL NOT BE MOCKED!!!"  His audience is having trouble suppressing snickers, but you can hear laughter all throughout the throne room.   He says, "I shall not be mocked" over and over again."

For some reason the Emperor is entertaining the crowd causing them to laugh rather than being ridiculed.
