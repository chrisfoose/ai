Kling Pro is a fantastic video generator.  The resolution is crisp, very high quality, and professional.

Here I am attempting to make a 10 second video.

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mocked.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Sound is done by MMAudio and honestly it leaves a lot to be desired.
