Getting MMAudio to work on an AMD GPU is no walk in the park.  With Nvidia it's just install it and run.  With AMD there is endless tweaking.

First of all, you have to install special WHL files which can be found at 

https://github.com/scottt/rocm-TheRock/releases/tag/v6.5.0rc-pytorch-gfx110x?ref=ai.rncz.net

Then, after that is done there is installing modules manually using pip.  For this I used the Miniforge environment, which is what they recommend.
