A bit morbid but I wanted to test the limits of what Flux and Wan would allow me to create.  It did okay.

I added the sound after making the video using an online service called mmaudio.  It's okay but I can probably find better.

Here’s my video:

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/kids_splat_with_sound.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
