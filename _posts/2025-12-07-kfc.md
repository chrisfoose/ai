I call this part of my "Distinguished Southern Gentleman" collection.  Sorry, it is me again.

I created the original photo using Flux Dev 1 again.  I told it to make me look a 'little bit' like Colonel Sanders.

Then, I loaded the photo in WAN 2.2 and told it to add the bucket of chicken and have me eating it.  

I believe this video is 480 by 480 and to create it took 3 hours on my AMD RX 7600. 

Let me rant a bit about AI and AMD.  It it such a pain to get up running since the market is geared towards Nvidia and they are undeniably domininant in this sector.  AMD and Intel seem to not give a hoot.

Nevertheless, I can still make some stuff.

Here’s my video:
