Okay, so this one's a little silly.

To generate the image that the video was based on I used Flux Dev 1, which seems to be my favorite so far.  I added my chrisfoose.lora that I was able to train via Replicate for probably $1.50 using 60 something images of myself.  Apologies if I seem so vain.

A slave was supposed to be thrown in front of me and then dragged off by Imperial Guards.  Well, instead a baby fell from the sky and some dudes came and just took him.

Here’s my video:
